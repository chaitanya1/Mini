Botanists need a computer-aided tool without human interaction to study and identify leaves instead of holding a plant encyclopedia. Huge volumes of biological information are now providing online access to hundreds and thousands of images of specimens, helping to digitize the complete specimen collection of the leaf images.Such a system will return within seconds the top matching species, along with supporting data that describes about textual descriptions and high resolution type specimen images just by feeding into the computer the photograph of a leaf specimen By using our system, a botanist in this field can quickly search the entire collections of plant species within seconds which earlier took hours together.
